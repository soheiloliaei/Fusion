## **ðŸŽ¯ Core Features Implemented**

### **1. Dynamic LLM-Generated Case Tiles**
**Real-time AI processing visualization:**
- "AI is analyzing Marcus's transaction confirmations..."
- "Scam probability: 96% - awaiting your approval"
- "Educational response drafted - ready to send"
- **Live status updates** as AI works autonomously

### **2. AI Copilot Chat Interface**
**Conversational AI collaboration:**
```
Advocate: "Why did you recommend Rush over Priority for Marcus?"
AI: "Based on his transaction history, he values speed but is price-sensitive. 
    Rush saves him $2.50 while still meeting his 30-min timeline."

Advocate: "What's the confidence on the romance scam?"
AI: "96%. Wallet linked to 23 other reports + 'sick grandmother' keyword 
    match. Should I call the customer now?"
```

### **3. Multi-Channel Communication Orchestration**

- **Automatic escalation** when confidence drops below thresholds

### **Human Oversight Points:**
1. **High-risk actions** (scam calls, large transactions)
2. **Vulnerable customers** (seniors, first-time users)
3. **Policy edge cases** (unusual transaction patterns)
4. **Low confidence scores** (<80% certainty)

### **Multi-Channel Orchestration:**
- **Unified interface** for email, call, SMS, chat
- **Context-aware messaging** based on customer profile
- **Auto-scheduling** with human approval gates
- **Response tracking** and follow-up automation
