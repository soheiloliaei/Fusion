I can upgrade you to Rush speed for just $2.50 - this will complete in about 10 minutes instead of the remaining 38 minutes. Would you like me to proceed with the Rush upgrade?"
- **Time:** 3:15 PM

### **Step 7: Customer Confirms Selection**
- **Customer Response:** "Yes, please upgrade to Rush speed for $2.50. 10 minutes sounds much better than 38 minutes. Please proceed!"
