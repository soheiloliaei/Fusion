# Fusion Agent Availability Fix

## 🚨 Issue Identified

You were seeing only 6 placeholder agents instead of the full 22 available agents because you were using the old `fusion_launcher.py` which uses the outdated `execution_chain_orchestrator.py` with placeholder agents.

## ✅ Solution

The correct system to use is `fusion.py` which has all 22 agents properly imported and registered.

```

### Method 2: Using the new launcher
```bash
# List all agents
python3 fusion_launcher_v14.py list

# Run single agent
python3 fusion_launcher_v14.py run vp_design "Design a mobile app for task management"

# Run pipeline
python3 fusion_launcher_v14.py pipeline "Design a complete user experience"
```

### Method 3: Using the command file
```bash
# Double-click or run
./Fusion_v14_Launcher.command
```

## 📁 Files Created/Fixed

1. **`fusion_launcher_v14.py`** - New launcher that shows all 22 agents
2. **`Fusion_v14_Launcher.command`** - Executable command file for easy access

## 🎯 Key Differences

| Old System | New System |
|------------|------------|
| `fusion_launcher.py` | `fusion.py` |
| 6 placeholder agents | 22 real agents |
| `execution_chain_orchestrator.py` | `execution_orchestrator_v14.py` |
| Placeholder classes | Real agent classes |

## ✅ Verification

All 22 agents have been tested and are working correctly. The system now properly shows:

- ✅ All 22 agents available
- ✅ All agents can be imported successfully
- ✅ All agents respond to prompts
- ✅ Full pipeline functionality working

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. Use `fusion.py` instead of `fusion_launcher.py`
2. Use the new `fusion_launcher_v14.py` for easier access
3. All 22 agents are now available and functional
4. Test different agents with various prompts to explore their capabilities
